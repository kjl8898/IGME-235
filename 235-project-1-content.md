# Game Proposal

## Tether Space

### High Concept
* The player must jump from orbiting around one tether point to another, gaining a higher combo score and avoiding obstacles.

### Genre
* Casual Physics-based

### Platform
*	Desktop with mobile support as a stretch goal

### Story
*	The game is abstract, such as Tetris, and therefore has no story

### Esthetics
*	Simple polygon shapes with neon colors on a black, space style background

### Gameplay
*	The main gameplay is based on timing. The player revolves around a tether point and must time when they release from the tether. The goal is to reach another tether point as quickly as possible to increase a combo score. Colliding with a tether or other obstacle ends the game. Speed is lost while not in tethered with a point, and conversely built up while tethered.
*	Only one input will be needed to release and create a tether. This will probably be the space bar, left mouse click, or both for ease of use. Because of the need for only one input, if there is time to optimize the game code for mobile, it would also be possible to add a simple tap as the input.
*	The game will always start with the player orbiting a tether, being prompted to give an input to start the game. Once the input is given, the player will be released and a tether will spawn off screen in their flight path. All other tethers will be randomly spawned near the player. The player cannot reuse tethers

### Stretch Goals
*	Diverse powerups such as the ability to create a tether or boost in a direction mid flight
*	Obstacles such as gravity wells, walls, and deflectors players can bounce off of
*	Sounds for more responsive and gratifying feedback
*	Cool particle effects
*	Mobile support
