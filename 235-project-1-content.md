# Game Proposal

## Tether Space

### High Concept
* The player must jump from orbiting around one tether point to another, gaining a higher combo score and avoiding obstacles.

### Genre
* Casual Physics-based

### Platform
*	Desktop with mobile support as a stretch goal

### Story
*	The game is abstract, such as Tetris, and therefore has no story

### Esthetics
*	Simple polygon shapes with neon colors on a black, space style background

### Gameplay
*	The main gameplay is based on timing. The player revolves around a tether point and must time when they release from the tether. The goal is to reach another tether point as quickly as possible to increase a combo score. Colliding with a tether or other obstacle ends the game. Speed is lost while not in tethered with a point, and conversely built up while tethered.
*	Only one input will be needed to release and create a tether. This will probably be the space bar, left mouse click, or both for ease of use. Because of the need for only one input, if there is time to optimize the game code for mobile, it would also be possible to add a simple tap as the input.
*	The game will always start with the player orbiting a tether, being prompted to give an input to start the game. Once the input is given, the player will be released and a tether will spawn off screen in their flight path. All other tethers will be randomly spawned near the player. The player cannot reuse tethers

### Stretch Goals
*	Diverse powerups such as the ability to create a tether or boost in a direction mid flight
*	Obstacles such as gravity wells, walls, and deflectors players can bounce off of
*	Sounds for more responsive and gratifying feedback
*	Cool particle effects
*	Mobile support

## Summery Section

Tether Space is a fast paced physics game. Bounce from tether to tether while growing your combo.Leave a tether too quickly and you may fly into nowhere. Wait too long and you'll lose your combo.And your life... In the game, that is.

## Quick Description Pieces
(Order does matter)

1. Your combo is constantly burning
2. Jump from tether point to tether point to increase your combo
3. Lose your combo and its game over
4. You'll lose speed when not tethered
5. You automatically reel into a tether point to increase speed
6. Don't reel in too far or you'll hit the tether and lose

## Designing the Site

### Putting Content in the Driver’s Seat

My main concern when deciding on how to build the site was how will it fit the game? Having a site that looks unrelated to the game just wasn’t going to cut it for me. I knew I wanted the game to have a black, empty backdrop for bright neon colors to pop out on. After playing around with some color schemes, I finally settled on bright neon blue and pink, with hints of yellow here and there. The pink and blue really set the neon theme. Yellow fits too but stands out a bit. Its perfect for drawing attention to certain areas and contrasts well on the black background.

### Tethering the Player

Building a landing page was a new concept for me. I quickly looked up some other game sites and noticed a common theme: to get someone’s attention, make things quick, concise, and flashy. The landing page opens with a mockup of the game. I plan to change this to an actual gameplay image (or even a video) so newcomers know exactly what’s going on from the get-go. Following is a quick description of the game and a short rundown of the mechanics. If I have the time, I plan on adding small images to match each of the six mechanic descriptors. I wanted new viewers to know almost exactly what to expect from the game just by looking at this page.

### Responding Responsivly

It wasn’t until I went to show my website on my laptop to some friends that I discovered I had made a grave mistake: The lab computers I had been designing on used 4k monitors. What looked great on them looked terrible on smaller screens. I had heard before that web developers often used multiple devices in their desk setups for testing responsiveness. What I’ve found, however, is that I don’t fully understand the importance of some things until I experience the downsides myself. Thus sparked the crusade on my unresponsive designs.

## Designing the Game

### Being Realistic

My previous game design classes introduced me to the concept of realistic scope. It was an idea we discussed, but given about twelve weeks to make a game doesn’t properly reflect it in my opinion. Over the summer, I participated in a 48 hour game jam. This is where scaling scope really set in. So that is where I started with this game: what was something with relatively simple mechanics yet engaging enough to keep attention. With only basic knowledge of JavaScript currently, I didn’t want to bite off more than I could chew either. A game made by the [game development YouTuber Dani](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIabPXjvT5BVTxRDPCBBOOQ) came to mind. He made a simple game about rapidly bouncing from point to point, gaining a high score as you went.

### Innovating on Inspiration

Obviously copying Dani’s game wouldn’t be the best idea, but I also wanted to avoid making a clone. I broke his game down into the basic concepts I wanted to replicate: abstract, chasing a high score, bouncing from points, and simple inputs. During the first couple weeks of class, we looked at previous student’s projects. One that stuck in my head was all about changing your orbit around a planet to hit another one. That’s where the tether idea came in.

### Revolving around the Tether

With the tether mechanics forming in my mind and the simple, arcade style as a set piece, Tether Space was born. I took orbiting around the tether as the main mechanic and designed the rest to compliment it. Jumping from tether to tether to keep a combo forces the player to quickly judge angles and speeds. Reeling into the tether increases speed, but also creates a risk reward. Reel in too long and you’ll hit the tether. Only needing the player to connect or detach from a tether means it only needs one input. Just like designing each page for this website, I started with the main content and designed the game idea around that.
