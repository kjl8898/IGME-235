# Portfolio

## Design

* I first started by looking at previous student's portfolios, as well
as a few others on the web. I picked out some pieces I liked and then 
drew out a design for my page layout.

## Creation

* I worked in a very linear style to create the site. I first implamented 
all the HTML items I needed until I had the basic framework done. I then 
started styling the header and worked my way down the page until the footer.
While styling, I added a few new HTML elements to help seperate content, 
making it both easier to see and work with.
